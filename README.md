# Note-taker-project
Creating a server to host a note taking app using express.js. I worked on this app with my tutor, Robert Kurle Jr., on March 13th, 2024. After first installing express.js, I created the server.js file and began working on the routing by creating index.js and notes.js files and exporting the modules within those files. Then we created the data persistence components within the notes.js file by creating a GET and POST request that utilized the fs package and JSON parsing to read notes and enable the ability to create new notes.
